# discord-moderation-bot/README.md (Markdown)

Based on the project description and tech stack provided below:

Project Overview:
- Create a discord moderation bot to help manage and maintain order within a discord server.
- Ensure the bot has essential features to assist moderators in enforcing rules and maintaining a positive community environment.

Features:
1. Automatic Moderation:
- Implement auto-moderation tools to detect and take action on inappropriate content such as spam, NSFW, and offensive language.
- Set up word filters to automatically delete or warn users when prohibited words are used.

2. User Management:
- Allow moderators to warn, mute, kick, or ban users who violate server rules.
- Provide a command for moderators to check a user's warning history or status.

3. Customizable Commands:
- Create custom commands that can be triggered by specific keywords or phrases.
- Enable the bot to respond with preset messages or actions based on user input.

4. Logging and Reporting:
- Log all moderation actions taken by the bot for transparency and record-keeping.
- Generate reports on user activity, warnings issued, and bans to help moderators track and address recurring issues.

5. Role Management:
- Allow moderators to assign and remove roles from users based on their behavior or status.
- Implement role restrictions to control access to certain channels or features within the server.

Enhancements:
1. AI Integration:
- Integrate AI technology to help the bot learn and adapt to the server's specific rules and community standards.
- Enable the bot to provide more accurate and personalized moderation based on past interactions.

2. User Feedback System:
- Incorporate a feedback system where users can report issues or suggest improvements directly to the bot.
- Utilize feedback data to improve bot performance and enhance user experience over time.

3. Multi-server Support:
- Enable the bot to be used across multiple discord servers simultaneously.
- Implement server-specific settings to customize moderation rules and behavior for each server.

Programming Languages:
- Use JavaScript for developing the discord moderation bot due to its compatibility with Discord.js library and ease of integration with Discord APIs.

APIs:
- Discord API: To interact with the Discord platform, manage messages, users, and roles, and implement moderation functionalities.

Packages and Libraries:
- Discord.js (v13.1.0): To create the bot, handle events, and interact with the Discord API efficiently.
- Filter (v2.0.0): For setting up word filters to detect and moderate inappropriate content.
- Winston (v3.3.3): For logging moderation actions and generating reports for transparency and record-keeping.
- AI.js (v1.2.0): To integrate AI technology for improved moderation accuracy and personalized interactions.
- Feedback (v1.0.0): For implementing a user feedback system to collect and process user suggestions and reports.

Rationale:
- JavaScript is the preferred language for Discord bot development, ensuring seamless integration with Discord APIs.
- Discord.js provides a robust framework for building bots, handling events, and interacting with the Discord API.
- Filter package enables automatic moderation by detecting and filtering out inappropriate content.
- Winston is used for logging moderation actions and generating reports to enhance transparency and accountability.
- AI.js integration enhances bot capabilities by leveraging AI for learning and adapting to server-specific rules.
